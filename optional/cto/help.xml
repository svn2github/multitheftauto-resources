CAPTURE THE ORB

The point of the game is to get the glowing yellow ORB to it's destination, indicated by a checkered flag on the radar. You can steal the orb from other players in several ways, including killing them, running them over, or bumping into their vehicle. If you are driving with the orb, be careful, as your car's handling and speed will be effected by the orb's mysterious properties.

How do you win the game? By reaching the point limit first. You earn points for picking up the orb, and more for capturing it.

What if someone drops the orb in a place that's hard to reach? Players can try to do jumps with their cars, or think of various other ways to reach the orb. But if no one gets it for 5 minutes, the orb will reset.
