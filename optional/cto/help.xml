Capture The Orb

The aim of the game is to capture the orb and take it to the objective. When a round starts, the orb will be placed at a random location (yellow blob on radar), and the first player to get to it can capture it.

To make a player drop the orb, you can either kill them, run over them, or give them a bash if they're in a vehicle. Once they've dropped the orb, you have a chance to capture it yourself by simply walking/driving through it. (Note: If you're driving whilst carrying the orb it will affect the vehicle's handling.)

Whoever picks up the orb will then be told to take it to the objective, displayed on the radar as a checkered flag. Once the orb has been returned to the objective successfully, their score will increase and a new orb will be created.
