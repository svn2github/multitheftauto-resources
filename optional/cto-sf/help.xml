Capture The Orb - San Fierro Map

Vehicles are placed around several player spawns across the map, and are an essential tool for reaching your objective.

Since the map is not full of parked cars, there is a vehicle creation feature you can use in case you are stranded.

Type "createvehicle [vehicle name]" to create the vehicle of your choice. You are restricted on how frequently you can create vehicles and their types, so choose carefully!
